<h1>Building from Sources</h1>

Building from sources is only required if a package is not available for your GNU/Linux distribution.

<h2 id="recent">Contributing Packages</h2>

<!--While we are well aware that building and installing from source is not as easy as installing a binary package, unfortunately we do not have the time and resources to create packages for every single GNU/Linux distribution. But you could help: creating a package does not actually require much more work than building and installing from sources. If you are willing to take the extra steps and contribute a package, read <a href="packaging.html">these instructions</a>.-->
Creating an installable package does not actually require much extra work compared to building and installing from source. If you are willing to take the extra steps and contribute a package to help us and other users, please read <a href="packaging.html">these instructions</a>.

<!-- ******************************************** Building/Recent ******************************************** -->

<h2 id="recent">Recent GNU/Linux Distributions</h2>

Follow the instructions in this section if your distribution is recent enough to include cmake&nbsp;>=&nbsp;2.8.6 and Qt4&nbsp;>=&nbsp;4.8.0. Otherwise read the instructions for <a href="#older">Older GNU/Linux Distributions</a>.

<!-- Environment -->
<h3>Setting up the Environment</h3>
Install g++, cmake and Qt4 (headers and libraries) using your preferred package manager. For instance, on Debian-based distributions type:

<div class="code">
<pre>
# sudo apt-get install g++ cmake libqt4-dev
</pre>
</div>

<!-- Building and Installing -->
<h3>Building and Installing the Libraries and Applications</h3>

Always make sure you start by building and installing LibKlustersShared. This shared library is required by Klusters, Neuroscope and NDManager.
<br><br>
All source packages (including LibKlustersShared) are built and installed in the same manner:
<div class="code">
<pre>
(extract the archive and cd inside)
# mkdir build
# cd build
# cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
(become root)
# make install
</pre>
</div>

Depending on your distribution, you may need to adapt the 'cmake' command above:
<div class="code">
<pre>
# cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DLIB_SUFFIX=64 ..
</pre>
</div>

<!-- ******************************************** Build/Older ******************************************** -->

<h2 id="older">Older GNU/Linux Distributions</h2>

Follow the instructions below if your distribution is too old to include cmake&nbsp;>=&nbsp;2.8.6 or Qt4&nbsp;>=&nbsp;4.8.0. Otherwise read the instructions for <a href="#recent">Recent GNU/Linux Distributions</a>.

<!-- Environment -->
<h3>Setting up the Environment</h3>
Install g++ using your preferred package manager. For instance, on Debian-based distributions type:

<div class="code">
<pre>
# sudo apt-get install g++
</pre>
</div>

Download the latest versions of <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html">cmake</a> and <a href="http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/qt/4.8/4.8.4/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.4.tar.gz">qt4</a>, and build them. 

<div class="code">
<pre>
# tar xvzf qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.4.tar.gz
# ./configure
(become root)
# make install
</pre>

<pre>
# tar xvzf cmake-2.8.11.1.tar.gz
# cd cmake-2.8.11.1
# ./configure
(become root)
# make install
</pre>
</div>
